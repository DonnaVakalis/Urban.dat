Exercises related to data science for architecture and engineering... because this field is still relatively young, I am keeping this repository language-agnostic and a catch-all for any exercises related to arch and/or engineering. Examples include work for the course "Data Science for Construction, Architecture and Engineering" MOOC [https://www.edx.org/course/Data-Science-for-Construction-Architecture-and-Engineering]
